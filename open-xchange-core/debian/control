Description: Log4J logging transitional package
 Open-Xchange used either Java Util logging or Log4J logging framework. Logging
 through Java Util logging was the default while the package open-xchange-log4j
 installed logging through Log4J framework. Starting with the 7.4.2 release
 both frameworks are replaced with the SLF4J logging API and its best
 implementation Logback.
 This transitional package tries to migrate the Log4J configuration to an
 according configuration for Logback during upgrade process. This applies only
 to additionally configured logger levels. After upgrade this package can be
 safely removed.
