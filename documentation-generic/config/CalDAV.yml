      description: |
        Appointments and tasks are available via the CalDAV interface if they fall 
        into a configurable timeframe. This value specifies the start time of this 
        interval, i.e. how  many days in the past should be considered. More formal, 
        this value defines the negative offset in days relative to the current date 
        representing the minimum end time of appointments and tasks to be synchronized.
        A value of "0" disables the limit, which is the default.

        Tells users where to find a caldav folder. This can be displayed in frontends.
        You can use the variables [hostname] and [folderId]. 
        If you chose to deploy caldav as a virtual host (say 'dav.open-xchange.com') use
        <code>https://dav.open-xchange.com/caldav/[folderId]</code> as the value
        If you are using user-agent sniffing use
        <code>https://[hostname]/caldav/[folderId]</code>
      defaultValue: https://[hostname]/caldav/[folderId]
