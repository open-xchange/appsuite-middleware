Description: network-wide graphing framework (user contributed plugins for node)
 Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of
 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still
 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.
 .
 This package contains Open-Xchange plugins for the Munin node.
 .
 Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent
 RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can follow a link
