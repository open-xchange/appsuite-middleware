# Life time of a session in the short term session containers. After this time the session is put into the long life time container and all
# temporary session data is removed. This only applies if com.openexchange.sessiond.autologin is enabled.

# This amount of time a session can live without any interaction, if com.openexchange.sessiond.autologin is enabled. First the session lives
# in the short term session container, see configuration option com.openexchange.sessiond.sessionDefaultLifeTime. Then the session is moved
# into the long term session container. The session can be restored from here, but it won't have any temporary session data anymore.
# Restoring temporary session data may cause some slower functionality and maybe temporary errors on image, proxy data or the like. The
# overall time a session can live is defined by this option. The life time in the long term session container is the time configured here
# subtracted by the time in the short term session container.
