  pattern:

    description: 'Search contacts with the given startletter. If this field is present, the pattern is matched against the contact field which is specified by the property "contact_first_letter_field" on the server (default: last name). Otherwise, the pattern is matched against the display name.'
  folder:
    type: array
    description: If a list of folder identifiers or at least a single folder identifier is given, only in that folders will be searched for contacts. This paramenter is optional but searching in all contact folders that are viewable and where objects can be read in is more expensive on that database than searching in a dedicated number of them. The possibility to provide here an array of folder identifier has been added with 6.10.
