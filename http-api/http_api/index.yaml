  - name: Login
    description: |
      The login module is used to obtain a session from the user's login credentials. To understand the details
      of the different login methods, see the article titled [Login variations](http://oxpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Login_variations).
      
      Because of security reasons each login variation will reject requests containing the parameter
      "password" within the URL query (starting with 7.8.0). 
  - name: Config
    description: |
      The config module is used to retrieve and set user-specific configuration. The configuration is
      stored in a tree. Each node of the tree has a name and a value. The values of leaf nodes are strings
      which store the actual configuration data. The values of inner nodes are defined recursively as
      objects with one field for each child node. The name and the value of each field is the name and the
      value of the corresponding child node, respectively.
  - name: Folders
    description: |
      The folders module is used to access the OX folder structure.
      
      Special system folders:
      
      <table class=simpleTable>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>contacts</td>
            <td>System Users</td>

  - name: Import
    description: 'The module import allows to import specific module data (like Contacts, Tasks or Appointments) in several formats (iCal, vCard, CSV) into a folder. Please note: The callback for all actions of this bundle is `callback_import`, not `callback_$actionname` for legacy purposes.'
  - name: Export

  - name: Sync
    description: The module sync delivers several core API extensions to support common operations used in a mobile synchronization environment.
  - name: Token
    description: The module token delivers several core API extensions to support token based logins.
  - name: Mailfilter
    description: |
      The mailfilter module is used to access all mail filter related options.
      
      First of all the main structure of a mail filter script is, that it has different rules. Each of them contains one command. This command takes a test condition which executes the actions given in that command if the test condition is true.
      The test condition consists of a test command and some arguments for this command depending on the command itself. Because the available tests depend on the mail filter server, these tests must be determined at runtime. So that no test field is transferred to the server which it isn't able to handle. Examples for tests are `address`, `allof` and `anyof`.
      Each test has a special comparison. The list of available comparisons depends on the test given and the mail filter server configuration so they have to be determined at runtime too. See chapter [Mail filter](#mail-filter) for more information.
  - name: File
    description: The ajax file upload module offers to store files in server's dedicated download directory for a configureable amount of time. The files are then accessible for further operations like inline images in (html) mails.
  - name: Image
    description: The image module allows to download images from Open-Xchange server without providing a session ID in request's URL parameters.
  - name: Conversion
    description: The conversion module is a generic module to request data from a data source and to process obtained/submitted data with a data handler. Thus data is converted from a data source by a data handler.
  - name: Mailaccount
    description: The mailaccount module is used to manage multiple mail accounts held by a user (available since v6.12).
  - name: Autoconfig
    description: The module autoconfig can be used to request the best available settings for an appropriate mail server (available since v6.22).
  - name: User
    description: The user module is used to access user information (available since v6.14).
  - name: User/Me
    description: The module user/me is used to access formal information about current user (available since v7.6.2).
  - name: OAuth
    description: |
      The Open-Xchange server can act as an OAuth client (starting with v6.20) or be an OAuth provider itself (starting with v7.8.0). The OAuth module supports both aspects:
       * Manage multiple OAuth accounts for certain online services for a user. The OAuth mechanism allows the Open-Xchange application to act as behalf of this user using previously obtained access tokens granted by user. The according interface is divided into two parts: Account access and service's meta data access.
       * Manage granted accesses of external services that can access a users data on his behalf, called "grants".
  - name: JSlob
    description: The JSlob module is used to store and retrieve arbitrary JSON-structured configuration for a single user (available since v6.22).
  - name: Freebusy
    description: Provides access to free/busy information (available since v6.22.1).
  - name: Messaging
    description: |
      The messaging module is divided into services which represent a messaging backend (they add a new folder module "messaging"),
      into accounts which represent the concrete configuration of accounts for a given messaging service, and into messages which
      represent single messages consisting of some metadata, headers and a content.
  - name: Snippet
    description: Available since v7.0.0/v6.22.0.
  - name: Halo
  - name: Capabilities
    description: Provides access to capabilities, i.e. modules or features that are available on the backend and the user has access to (available since v7.4.2).
  - name: Jump
    description: The jump module is used to pass an acquired identity token for an authenticated user from one system to another for a single sign-on (available since v7.6.0).
  - name: Find
    description: |
      The find module consists of calls for performing searches within the modules mail, contacts, tasks and drive.
      It was designed to provide an iterative approach where the search criteria can be refined step-wise until
      the desired items are found.  The starting point is always an `autocomplete` request, that suggests possible
      search filters based on a users input. Those filters are grouped into categories, called "facets".
      A facet may provide one or more values with every value being a possible filter. A client is meant to remember
      every value that was selected by a user and include it within the following `autocomplete` and `query` requests,
      while `query` performs the actual search and returns the found items.
      
      Some of the objects returned by the server contain former user input. A client must never interpret strings as HTML
      but always as plain text to be not vulnerable for CSS attacks!
      
      Preliminary, available since v7.6.1.
  - name: Share/Management
    description: |
      The share/management module can create and manage share links via different actions. Dedicated actions to list all shares of a
