          An array with new, modified and deleted infoitems. New and modified infoitems are represented by arrays. The
          elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the `columns`
          parameter. Deleted infoitems would be identified by their object IDs as string, without being part of
          a nested array. In case of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see
          [Error handling](https://documentation.open-xchange.com/latest/middleware/http_api/1_introduction.html#error-handling)).
