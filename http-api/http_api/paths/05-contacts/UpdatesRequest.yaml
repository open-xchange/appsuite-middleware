        description: |
          An array with new, modified and deleted contacts. New and modified contacts are represented by arrays.
          The elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the
          `columns` parameter. Deleted contacts (should the ignore parameter be ever implemented) would be identified
          by their object IDs as integers, without being part of a nested array. In case of errors the
          responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
