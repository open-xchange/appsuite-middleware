    summary: Performs the actual search and returns the found items (**available since v7.6.1**).
    description: |
      Before querying the search you should fetch the search filters (facets) by calling the [/find?action=autocomplete](#operation--find-action-autocomplete-put) 
      request.
      #### Active facets
      Every value that has been selected by a user must be remembered and provided with every subsequent request.
      The representation of a facet within a request body differs from the one within an autocomplete response.
      We call those "active facets". Their representation is independent from their style.

          The name of the module within that the search shall be performed. Possible modules are: mail, contacts,
          calendar, tasks, drive. Because a user may have limited access to modules the useable modules might only
          be a subset of the available ones. Retrieve a list of allowed modules by querying the user configuration,
          see module "config" (path `search`) or module "JSlob" (e.g. `id=io.ox/core`).
