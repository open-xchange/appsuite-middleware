      The request accepts file fields in upload form that denote referenced files that are going to be appended
      as attachments.
      For "text/plain" mail bodies, the JSON boolean field "raw" may be specified inside the body's JSON
      representation to signal that the text content shall be kept as-is; meaning to keep all formatting
      intact.
    consumes:
      - multipart/form-data
      - multipart/mixed
    produces:
      - text/html

          'Contains the rudimentary mail as JSON string (see [SendMailData](#/definitions/SendMailData) model) with just its message body
          (as html content) defined in nested JSON array `attachments` and its header data (from, to,
          subject, etc.). The field "content_type" defines whether the mail ought to be sent as plain text
          ("text/plain"), as html ("text/html") or as multipart/alternative ("ALTERNATIVE"). Sending a mail
          requires some special fields inside JSON mail object. The field "infostore_ids" defines a JSON
          array of infostore document ID(s) that ought to be appended to this mail as attachments. The field
          "msgref" indicates the ID of the referenced original mail. Moreover the field "sendtype" indicates
          the type of the message.' 
        enum:

          - 2 (a forward mail, field `msgref` must be present)
          - 3 (draft edit operation, field `msgref` must be present in order to delete previous draft message since e.g. IMAP does not support changing/replacing a message but requires a delete-and-insert sequence)
          - 4 (transport of a draft mail, field `msgref` must be present)
          - 6 (signals that user intends to send out a saved draft message and expects the draft message (referenced by `msgref` field) being deleted after successful transport)
