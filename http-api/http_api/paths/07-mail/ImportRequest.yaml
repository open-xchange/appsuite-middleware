    summary: Import of mails as MIME data block ([RFC822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822)) (**available since v6.18**).
    description: |
      This request can be used to store a single or a lot of mails in the OX mail storage backend. This
      action should be used instead of [/mail?action=new](#operation--mail-action-new-post) because it is faster and tolerant to 8-bit encoded emails.
      
      To import multiple mails add further form-data fields.
