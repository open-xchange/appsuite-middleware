          A JSON object containing an array with data for all folders that are
          considered as shared by the user.

          Each array element describes one folder and is itself an array. The
          elements of each array contain the

          information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the
          `columns` parameter. In case

          of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see
          [Error handling](#error-handling)).
