      This request can be used to store a single or a lot of mails in the OX
      mail storage backend. This

      action should be used instead of
      [/mail?action=new](#operation--mail-action-new-post) because it is faster
      and tolerant to 8-bit encoded emails.


      To import multiple mails add further form-data fields.
    parameters:
      - in: query
        name: folder

          In case the mail should be stored with status "read" (e.g. mail has
          been read already in the client inbox), the parameter "flags" has to
          be included. For information about mail flags see [Detailed mail
          data](#detailed-mail-data).
