      #### Note

      It is possible to create multiple attachments at once. Therefore add
      additional form fields and replace "[index]" in `file_[index]` 

      with the appropriate index, like `file_1`. The index always starts with 0
      (mandatory attachment object). There can only be

      one json payload describing the EventData, the rest json payloads (if
      present) will simply be ignored.
