      #### Note:

      It is possible to update multiple attachments at once. Therefore add
      additional form fields and replace "[index]" in `file_[index]` with 
      the appropriate index, like `file_1`. The index always starts with 0
      (mandatory attachment object). There can only be one json payload 
      describing the EventData, the rest json payloads (if
      present) will simply be ignored.

      If the event already has attachments, then for each of those attachments
      their valid manageId must be provided as part of the attachment metadata. 

      The absense of an already existing attachment for the event will
      result in the deletion of that attachment.
