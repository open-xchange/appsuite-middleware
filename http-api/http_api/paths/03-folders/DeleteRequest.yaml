          If set to `true`, the folders are deleted permanently. Otherwise, and if the underlying storage
          supports a trash folder and the folders are not yet located below the trash folder, they are moved
          to the trash folder.

          An array with object IDs of folders that were NOT deleted. There may be a lot of different causes
          for a not deleted folder: A folder has been modified in the mean time, the user does not have the
          permission to delete it or those permissions have just been removed, the folder does not exist, etc.
          You receive an empty JSON array if everything worked well. In case of errors the responsible fields
          in the response are filled (see [Error handling](https://documentation.open-xchange.com/latest/middleware/http_api/1_introduction.html#error-handling)).
