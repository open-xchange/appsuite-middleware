          An array with new and deleted attachments. New attachments are
          represented by arrays. The

          elements of each array contain the information specified by the
          corresponding identifiers in the `columns`

          parameter. Deleted attachments would be identified by their object IDs
          as integer, without being part of

          a nested array. In case of errors the responsible fields in the
          response are filled (see

          [Error handling](#error-handling)).
