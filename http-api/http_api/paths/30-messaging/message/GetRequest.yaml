    summary: Gets a messaging message.
    description: |
      A messaging message consists of some metadata, headers and a content. The content attribute varies
      by the content-type header. If the content-type is `text/*` it is a string, if it is `multipart/*` it
      is an array of objects, each representing a part of the multipart. If it is anything else it is considered binary
      and is a Base64 encoded string.
      
      The folder ID of a message follows a predefined format: `[messagingService]://[accountId]/[path]`, like
      `com.openexchange.messaging.twitter://535/defaultTimeline/directMessages`.
