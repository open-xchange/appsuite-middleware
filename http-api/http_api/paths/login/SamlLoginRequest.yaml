    summary: Create App Suite session after SAML login flow
    description: >
      This API call is typically the result of a redirect created by the server.
      It does not

      need to be explicitly implemented by clients!


      After a successful SAML login flow, the client (web browser) is redirected

      to this endpoint, where the actual App Suite session gets created. As a
      result,

      the user gets redirected to
      `https://<webmail-domain>/<login-path>#session=<session-id>`.

      The redirect response has App Suite session cookies set.
