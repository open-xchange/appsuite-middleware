    summary: Processes multiple requests to other modules in a single request.
    description: |
      #### Not supported requests are:
       * the ones from modules login and multiple
       * POST requests with a multipart encoding (uploads)
       * GET requests which do not use an object as described in [Low level protocol](#low-level-protocol)
      
      #### Request body
      A JSON array with JSON objects describing the requests. Each object contains a field `module` with the
      name of the request's module and the field `action` with the concrete request action to execute. Additionally the
      parameters of the request are added as fields too. A session parameter is not included! If the request has
      a request body itself, this body is stored as a JSON object in a field `data`.
      
      #### Example: query reminder range and update a reminder's alarm
      ```json
      [{"module":"reminder","action":"range","end":1497461067180},{"module":"reminder","action":"remindAgain","id":51,"data":{"alarm":1459478800000}}]
      ```
