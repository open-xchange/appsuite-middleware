          A JSON object containing the appointment's data. The field `recurrence_id` is always present
          if it is present in the original appointment. The field `recurrence_position` is present if
          it is present in the original appointment and only this single appointment should be modified.
          The field `id` is not present because it is already included as a parameter. Other fields are
          present only if modified.
