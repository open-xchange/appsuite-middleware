          If the appointment could not be created due to conflicts, the response body is an object with the
          field `conflicts`, which is an array of appointment objects which caused the conflict. Each appointment
          object which represents a resource conflict contains an additional field `hard_conflict` with the
          Boolean value `true`. If the user does not have read access to a conflicting appointment, only the
          fields `id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `shown_as` and `participants` are present and the field `participants`
          contains only the participants which caused the conflict. In case of errors the responsible fields
          in the response are filled (see [Error handling](https://documentation.open-xchange.com/latest/middleware/http_api/1_introduction.html#error-handling)).'
