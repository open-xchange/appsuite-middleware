          A JSON object containing an array with data for the requested appointments. Each array element describes one appointment and
          is itself an array. The elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding

          are filled (see [Error handling](https://documentation.open-xchange.com/latest/middleware/http_api/1_introduction.html#error-handling)).
