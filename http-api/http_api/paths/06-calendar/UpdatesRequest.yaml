        description: |
          An array with new, modified and deleted appointments. New and modified appointments are represented by arrays.
          The elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the
          `columns` parameter. Deleted appointments (should the ignore parameter be ever implemented) would be identified
          by their object IDs as integers, without being part of a nested array. Appointment sequencies are broken up
          into individual appointments and each modified occurrence of a sequence in the requested range is returned
          separately. The appointments are sorted in ascending order by the field start_date. In case of errors the
          responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error handling](https://documentation.open-xchange.com/latest/middleware/http_api/1_introduction.html#error-handling)).
