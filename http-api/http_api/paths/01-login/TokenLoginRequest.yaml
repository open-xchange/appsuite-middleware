    summary: Login for a very short living session (**available since v7.0.1**).
    description: |
      This request allows every possible client to create a very short living session. This session can then be transferred to any other client preferably a browser entering then the normal web interface. Then the sessions life time will be extended equally to every other session.
      
      Compared to the login mechanism using the random token, this request is more secure because two tokens are used. One of these tokens is only known to the client and one is generated by the server. Only the combination of both tokens allows to use the session. The combination of both tokens must be done by the client creating the session.
      
      **DISCLAIMER:** This request MUST NOT be used by some server side instance. If some server side instance uses this request to create a session for a browser on some client machine, then you have to transfer the full URL with server and client token over some connection to the client. This creates a VULNERABILITY if this is done. The token login method is only secure if this request is already sent from the same machine that later runs the browser using the created session.

          True or false. True tells the UI to issue a store request for the session cookie. This store
          request is necessary if you want the autologin request not to fail. This must be enabled on
          the server and a client can test with the autologin request if it is enabled or not.

        description: |
          In case `jsonResponse=true`, it is returned a JSON object. Otherwise a redirect to the web UI.
          The URL of the web UI is either taken from the given parameter or from the configured default
          of the backend. This redirect will only contain the server side token. The client side token
          sent in the request must be appended by the client creating the session. The final URL must
          have the form redirect_URL&clientToken=token. Both tokens are necessary to use the session and
          both tokens must match. Otherwise the session is terminated. In case of errors the responsible
          fields in the response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
