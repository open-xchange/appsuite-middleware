          A JSON object containing an array with matching appointments.
          Appointments are represented by arrays. The elements of each array
          contain the

          information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the
          `columns` parameter. In case of errors the

          responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error
          handling](#error-handling)).
