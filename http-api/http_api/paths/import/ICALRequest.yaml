          imported through the given iCal file. This help keeping the Inbox

          parameter is checked.

        description: >-
          When set to `true`, UIDs are partially ignored during import of tasks
          and appointments from iCal. Internally, each UID is replaced
          statically by a random one to preserve possibly existing relations
          between recurring appointments in the same iCal file, but at the same
          time to avoid collisions with already existing tasks and appointments.
