Each field provides an array of objects.\n\nThe \"platforms\" field lists the available platforms for which a device can receive on-boarding information.\n\nThe \"devices\" field lists the concrete devices, which are supported to receive on-boarding information. Each object mainly provides:\n- A unique identifier for the associated device (e.g. \"apple.iphone\") and a display name\n- Whether the device is enabled; \"false\" to trigger upsell activities\n- A listing of applicable scenarios for the device consisting of composite identifiers (delimited by \"/\" character), which point to an entry from the \"matching\" object\n\nThe \"scenarios\" field provides all available on-boarding scenarios (like installing an app or receive a profile configuration for a built-in application; e.g. Apple Mail). Each scenario also provides:\n- A unique identifier and a display name\n- Whether the scenario is enabled along-side with \"missing_capabilities\" to trigger upsell activities\n- A description text for the user\n\nThe \"actions\" field represents the available actions that can be performed in order to transfer a certain on-boarding information to a device. As of now there are five possible actions for a certain device/scenario combination: \"download\", \"email\", \"display\", \"link\" and \"sms\".\n- \"download\" refers to a simple download that is performed; e.g. a profile configuration file.\n- \"email\" lets the Middleware to send out an E-Mail containing the on-boarding information.\n- \"sms\" lets the Middleware to send out an SMS containing the on-boarding information.\n- \"display\" represents a plain display of on-boarding information for manual setup. Actions of this type provide a composite identifier (delimited by \"/\" character) that also contains the concrete scenario to which that action applies; e.g. \"display/davsync\". Moreover it has a \"data\" field that provides the user-sensitive information to display; e.g. the mail settings.\n- \"link\" hints to an available link that a user can follow; e.g, a link to a certain app held in an app store. Actions of this type provide a composite identifier (delimited by \"/\" character) that also contains the concrete scenario to which that action applies. In addition there is a field for each device providing the exact link and type; e.g. having a link to Apple Appstore for an iPhone device.\n\nThe \"matching\" field is the combination of supported device, scenario and actions combinations. It provides an \"id\" field that contains a composite identifier (delimited by \"/\" character) to refer to the device and scenario combination; e.g. \"apple.ipad/mailsync\". Moreover, there is a listing of available action identifiers (pointing to entries from \"actions\") that are possible being executed in order to let such a device being on-boarded for the referenced scenario.'\n",

We distinguish three styles of facets:\n * simple\n * default\n * exclusive\n___\nEvery facet value contains an embedded `filter` object. The filter must not be changed by the client, it has\nto be seen as a black-box. Instead the filters of selected facet values have to be copied and sent to the\nserver with the subsequent requests.\n#### Simple facets\nA simple facet is a special facet that has exactly one value. The facet's type and its value are strictly\ncoupled, in a way that a display name for both, facet and value would be redundant. A simple facet generally\ndenotes a logical field like 'phone number'. Internally this logical field can map to several internal\nfields (e.g. 'phone_private', 'phone_mobile', 'phone_business'). In clients the facet as a whole can be\ndisplayed as a single item. Example: \"Search for 'term' in field 'phone number'\".\n#### Default facets\nA default facet contains multiple values and may be present multiple times in search requests to filter\nresults by a combination of different values (e.g. \"mails with 'foo' and 'bar' in subject\").\n\nFacet values may be one- or two-dimensional. A one-dimensional value can be displayed as is and contains an\naccording filter object. A two-dimensional value contains an array \"options\" with every option defining\ndifferent semantics of how the value is used to filter the search results.\n#### Exclusive facets\nAn exclusive facet is a facet where the contained values are mutually exclusive. That means that the facet\nmust only be present once in an autocomplete or query request.\n\nFacet values may be one- or two-dimensional. A one-dimensional value can be displayed as is and contains an\naccording filter object. A two-dimensional value contains an array \"options\" with every option defining\ndifferent semantics of how the value is used to filter the search results.\n",
