              * `CREDENTIALS_REFRESH` - State to indicate that the link belongs to a known share but is not accessible at the moment because the remote server indicates that credentials have been updated meanwhile.

              * `REMOVED` - State to indicate that the link belongs to a known share but can no longer be accessed.
              * `UNRESOLVABLE` - State to indicate that the share link can't be resolved at all and thus can't be subscribed.
