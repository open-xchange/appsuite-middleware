The combination of both tokens must be done by the client creating the session.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** This request MUST NOT be used by some server side instance. If some server side instance uses this request to create a session for a browser on some client machine, then you have to transfer the full URL with server and client token over some connection to the client.

        "description": "Filters are grouped into categories, the so called facets.\n#### Facets\nThe style of a facet is responsible for how the according object is structured, how it is handled on the\nserver-side and how the client has to handle it. We distinguish three styles of facets:\n * simple\n * default\n * exclusive\n___\nEvery facet value contains an embedded `filter` object. The filter must not be changed by the client, it has\nto be seen as a black-box. Instead the filters of selected facet values have to be copied and sent to the\nserver with the subsequent requests.\n#### Simple facets\nA simple facet is a special facet that has exactly one value. The facet's type and its value are strictly\ncoupled, in a way that a display name for both, facet and value would be redundant. A simple facet generally\ndenotes a logical field like 'phone number'. Internally this logical field can map to several internal\nfields (e.g. 'phone_private', 'phone_mobile', 'phone_business'). In clients the facet as a whole can be\ndisplayed as a single item. Example: \"Search for 'term' in field 'phone number'\".\n#### Default facets\nA default facet contains multiple values and may be present multiple times in search requests to filter\nresults by a combination of different values (e.g. \"mails with 'foo' and 'bar' in subject\").\n\nFacet values may be one- or two-dimensional. A one-dimensional value can be displayed as is and contains an\naccording filter object. A two-dimensional value contains an array \"options\" with every option defining\ndifferent semantics of how the value is used to filter the search results.\n#### Exclusive facets\nAn exclusive facet is a facet where the contained values are mutually exclusive. That means that the facet\nmust only be present once in an autocomplete or query request.\n\nFacet values may be one- or two-dimensional. A one-dimensional value can be displayed as is and contains an\naccording filter object. A two-dimensional value contains an array \"options\" with every option defining\ndifferent semantics of how the value is used to filter the search results.\n",
