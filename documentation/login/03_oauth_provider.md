title: OAuth 2.0 Provider
---

Starting with version v7.8.0, OX App Suite can act as an OAuth 2.0 provider that allows access to certain API calls. In terms of [RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) the App Suite backend acts as *authorization server* and *resource server* while every user is a *resource owner*. From v7.8.1 on it is also possible to use an external *authorization server*.
