# if testThreads is set to true, more information is logged to the Open-Xchange

# The following property allows to disable the replication monitor. This option is only useful if you have a MySQL master and slave setup.
# If the application code releases a connection to the MySQL master, a writing operation on the database is assumed. To be able to monitor
# the replication to the slave, a counter is increased after releasing the connection. Reading this counter from the slave indicates, the
# write operation is not replicated yet and instead of a slave connection a master connection is then used to read data. This prevents data
# reading inconsistencies. Unfortunately will this produce additional IO load on MySQL master and slave.
# This mechanism can be disabled with the following property. This saves IO load but it may cause data inconsistencies. Especially newly
# created objects can disappear in the following refresh requests.
