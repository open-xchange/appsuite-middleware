 * to write objects to streams. <p>
 *
 * Applications don't generally call the methods in DataContentHandlers
 * directly. Instead, an application calls the equivalent methods in
 * DataHandler. The DataHandler will attempt to find an appropriate
 * DataContentHandler that corresponds to its MIME type using the
 * current DataContentHandlerFactory. The DataHandler then calls
