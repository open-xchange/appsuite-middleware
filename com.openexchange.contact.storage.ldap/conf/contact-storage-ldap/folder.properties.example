# Properties file for a LDAP folder. 


# == Folder Properties =======================================================

# The context ID where the LDAP folder resides in. Required.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.contextID=

# The ID of the folder. Either the 'foldername' or the 'folderID' property must 
# be defined. If set, the folder ID must refer to an existing folder in the 
# context, which is then used by the storage.   
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.folderID=

# Defines the display name of the folder. Either the 'foldername' or the 
# 'folderID' property must be defined. If set, the folder name is bound to 
# a folder below the system folder "Public folders" (ID 2), and is implicitly
# created if it not yet exists, impersonating as the context administrator, 
# allowing 'read-only' kind of permissions for all users.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.foldername=

# The priority of the contact storage that is being registered in the server. 
# Any integer > 0 should be okay to override the default storage when 
# requesting the exposed LDAP folder. Defaults to 17.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.storagePriority=17


# == LDAP Attribute mapping ==================================================

# Controls the way object identifiers are mapped between OX and LDAP. Possible
# values are 'static', 'dynamic' and 'persistent'. A 'static' mapping requires
# numerical unique identifiers in LDAP, i.e. all mapped ID properties defined 
# in the mapping file point to an integer-parsable LDAP attribute. If the LDAP
# server does not provide unique numerical properties, either 'dynamic' or 
# 'persistent' ID mapping must be configured, whereas the first one stores the 
# mappings in memory per session, and the latter one stores the mapping table 
# in the database. Required.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.idMapping=persistent

# The filename containing the OX <-> LDAP attribute mappings for contacts. 
# Required. Multiple LDAP folders may share the same mapping properties file. 
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.mappingFile=


# == Cache ===================================================================

# Configures the internal cache refresh interval in milliseconds. Contact 
# caching requires an 'authtype' of either 'admindn' or 'anonymous', along 
# with an 'idMapping' of either 'persistent' or 'static' and a properly 
# configured cache via 'cacheConfigFile'. A refresh interval of '0' disables
# the cache. Defaults to '100000'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.refreshinterval=100000

# The filename containing the cache configuration. Required if caching is 
# enabled via 'refreshinterval'. Multiple LDAP folders may share the same 
# cache properties file.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.cacheConfigFile=cache.properties


# == LDAP Server =============================================================

# The URI of the LDAP server, should be in the format 
# ldap://myserver.example.com:389. For SSL access, use the ldaps protocol and 
# the appropriate port, e.g. ldaps://myserver.example.com:636. Required.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.uri=

# Configures a base LDAP path. If defined, all Distinguished Names supplied to 
# and received from LDAP operations will be relative to the LDAP path 
# supplied. If not defined, the default naming context of the RootDSE is used 
# as baseDN. 
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.baseDN=

# Specifies a general search filter that is applied to each LDAP search, e.g. 
# to restrict the search to one or more object classes. Required.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.searchfilter=


# == Authentication ==========================================================

# Configures the authentication type when accessing the LDAP server. Possible 
# values are 'anonymous', 'admindn' or 'user'. Setting the 'authtype' to 
# 'admindn' will always impersonate using the properties in 'AdminDN' and 
# 'AdminBindPW', while 'user' will always use the credentials from the current
# session's user, where the user's distinguished name is dynamically looked up 
# as configured via 'userLoginSource', 'userSearchAttribute' and following. 
# Required. 
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.authtype=anonymous

# Specify the admin bind DN here. Required if 'authtype' is set to 'AdminDN', 
# or if 'authtype' is set to 'user' and 'userAuthType' to 'AdminDN'. 
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.AdminDN=

# Specify the admin bind password here. Required if 'authtype' is set to 
# 'AdminDN', or if 'authtype' is set to 'user' and 'userAuthType' to 'AdminDN'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.AdminBindPW=

# Configures the format of the username that is used during dynamic lookups 
# for the corresponding user on the LDAP server. Required if 'authtype' is set 
# to 'user'. Possible values are 'login' (the user's individual mail login as 
# defined in user storage), 'mail' (the user's individual primary email 
# address) or 'name' (the user's individual system user name).
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.userLoginSource=

# Configures the LDAP attribute name that matches the username as defined by 
# 'userLoginSource' during dynamic lookups. Required if 'authtype' is set to 
# 'user'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.userSearchAttribute=

# Specify the authentication type when that is used during user lookup here. 
# Required if 'authtype' is set to 'user'. Possible values are 'anonymous' and 
# 'admindn', while the latter one will use the credentials defined in 
# 'AdminDN' and 'AdminBindPW'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.userAuthType=

# Configures the search scope that is used during user lookup. Possible values 
# are 'sub', 'base' and 'one'. If left empty, the general 'searchScope' is 
# used.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.userSearchScope=

# Configures the base LDAP path that is used during user lookup. If left empty, 
# the general 'baseDN' is used.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.userSearchBaseDN=

# Configures the search filter that is used during user lookup. If left empty, 
# the general 'searchfilter' is used.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.userSearchFilter=


# == Advanced LDAP configuration =============================================

# Configures how deep to search within the search base. Possible values are 
# 'sub' (entire subtree), 'base' (base object only) or 'one' (one level 
# subordinate to the base object). Defaults to 'sub'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.searchScope=sub

# Specifies how to handle referrals. Possible values are 'follow' to follow,
# 'ignore' to ignore referrals or 'standard' to use the default JNDI setting. 
# Defaults to 'follow'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.referrals=follow

# Defines whether LDAP connection pooling is enabled or not. Possible values 
# are 'true' and 'false'; defaults to 'false'.  
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.connectionPooling=

# If connection pooling is enabled, this configures the timeout when waiting 
# to access a pooled connection. Optional. 
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.pooltimeout=

# Controls how to dereference aliases. Possible values are 'always' to always,
# 'never' to never dereference aliases, 'finding' to dereference during name
# or 'searching' to dereference after name resolution. Defaults to 'always'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.derefAliases=always

# Specifies the requested size for paged results. '0' disables paged results. 
# Defaults to '500'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.pagesize=500

# Configures where the search results should be sorted. Possible values are 
# 'server' (sorting by the LDAP server) or 'groupware' (sorting by the 
# groupware server). Defaults to 'groupware'.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.sorting=groupware

# Specifies if support for querying deleted objects is enabled or not. When 
# enabled, deleted objects are identified with the filter 'isDeleted=TRUE',
# which is only available in Active Directory. There, information about 
# deleted objects are available for the following lifetimes:
# 60 days for forests initially built using W2k and Server 2k3
# 180 days for forests that were initially built with Server 2k3 SP1
# Possible values are 'true' and 'false', defaults to 'false'. When disabled,
# no results are available for this folder for the 'deleted' API call. 
# Therefore, any synchronization-based usage will not be available.
com.openexchange.contact.storage.ldap.ADS_deletion_support=false
